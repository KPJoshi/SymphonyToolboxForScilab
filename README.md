# Symphony Toolbox for Scilab

A toolbox that provides mixed integer linear programming tools in Scilab through the Symphony library

Tested with Symphony 5.5.6 and Scilab 5.5.2

## To use:
1. Download and extract the source to a new directory
2. In Scilab, change the working directory to this new directory
3. Run `exec builder.sce`
4. Run `exec loader.sce`
5. The library is now ready for use

This project is unfinished as of 27th May 2015 and hence lacks many features.
